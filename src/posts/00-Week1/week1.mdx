  <p className="post-text">
    These Chocolate Friands are from the Tartine book, and the recipe for the
    Friands can also be found on this site. Not the best looking things I've
    made lately since I utterly failed at properly greasing the mini muffin pans
    today, but they are a really fudgy brownie like cupcake. I would definitely
    make them again.
